W010C204880,"During the evening the north bound traffic on the Aarey Flyover @ Western Express Highway has been slowing down since ages. The reason for this and the entire traffic fiasco is undisciplined drivers and their wayward driving, also adding fuel to the fire is the government apathy of no clear markers or rules.\n\nThe flyover has 3 lanes. But during the peak time 8 lanes try to enter 3 lanes. Of course there\'s bound to be chaos. This phenomenon starts around 1730 hours. Around this time the traffic is flowing quite smoothly, but after this time the backlog starts building up & continues till late night.\n\nThe solution:\nInstead of opening a counter lane & disturbing the traffic on the other side, the traffic department should be barricading the first 2 lanes right from Andheri flyover until Magathane flyover. The 1st lane should be barricaded tightly - so that no vehicle moves out on the left lane. The 2nd lane should be loosely barricaded - so that the vehicles can exit to the left at regular intervals. The 3rd lane should obviously be free & easy.\n\nLikewise should be the case in the mornings on the south bound side of WEH",3,17,2,937,21,84,25,"12/1/17 16:16","Suggestion to resolve Peak Hour Traffic woes on Western Express Highway","Goregaon East, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"

W0100C206557,"Hi citizens, I live in one of the most popular and posh areas of Mumbai i.e. Andheri. An eye sore to this bustling place are multiple vehicles parked along the road and under the bridges. These are vehicles that are abandoned by their owners and left to rust away.\nNot only do they eat up expensive and highly sought after parking space, they also create an eye sore. Andheri being so close to the Airport and having all the top hotels in the state caters to lots of visitors and tourists.\nJust out of a world class and beautiful airport no one would like to see a rusted away skeleton of a Maruti or Ambassador or even an auto rickshaw. These cars become a breeding and resting place for stray animals and also places for indecent activities under the cloak of darkness. Some are even covered with garbage, urine and faecal matter.\nI urge the authorities to confiscate such vehicles, intimate the owners and give them a specified time to reclaim them back. If there is no response within the stipulated time then the vehicles should be sent for scrapping. Vintage and rare vehicles can be put up for auction.",3,19,2,943,21,84,25,"17-01-2017 11:18","Abandoned cars","1-107, Guru Hargovindji Rd, S B Singh Colony, J B Nagar, Andheri East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400059, India"

They have very meticuolusly chosen areas like Juhu, Santacruz, Chembur flyover, Andheri flyovers as their homes for years now. They too want a hyped lifestyle and want to live in the sparkling nights of Mumbai.\nDo they pay taxes or they have owned the foothpaths.  It is such a shabby and filthy look to see. Their royal families , cooking , sleeping , washing everything on the roads and no one is kicking them out. Make them stay on remote Mumbai , why here ?\nPlease do something. -These dirty illegal migrants have to be kicked out soon.\nEvery time our client comes out of Airport and has a look on the streets, i feel ashamed and am taken back.\nI am sure lakhs of Mumbaikars feel the same.\nSeal the flyovers - build gardens below the flyovers like how its done below matunga flyover.  Keep the footpaths free and not them house such people. Provide security and strict vigilance and beautify Mumbai please.\n\nRegards.\nMrs K.Iyengar",1,0,2,1010,15,61,22,"23-01-2017 17:02","Beggar shanties on Footpath for Yearsssssssss","Railway Colony, Santacruz West, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400047, India"

I can understand that if someone is unaware of the law he/she is given a warning not to repeat this next time, but i find this person taking them near the paper stall threatening them to book them in the police station and extracts money from them (bribe/extortion).\n\nI thought that this matter must be reported to the police station opposite Police station of the railway station but later found he is in hands in gloves with some constables.\n\nI have written to the Anti Corruption Bureau Maharashtra ACB (Worli) and had a talk with a senior Inspector who will be taking up this matter at his level and he has informed me to write about this matter to the concerning officials. Offence under IPC/CRPC.\n\nThere have been many of them complaining about his harassment  but fear to lodge a complain with the police station just opposite to the railway station.\n\nToday i sent in a dummy person to ask him why he is allowing two girls at each gate apporx. 6 girls to distribute their leaflets every alternate days and his reply in return was they are my people. Does to rule of law equal to one and all or to only certain people who can payoff.\n\nI have also got to learn that there are some people who have video footage of this person taking them to the paper stall in the corner and collecting money and letting them off. He has also deployed some agents(people) to give him information and later a commission is paid to them for the information. I would kindly request you to look into this matter as soon as possible.\n\nI have an appointment with the Sr. Inspector of Anti Corruption Bureau Maharashtra ACB (Worli) next week for further discussion on this matter.\n\nSorry i know my letter is to long but to give you a proper idea it was necessary.\n\nHoping to stop this meanies and abide by the rules of the country, state and city.\n\nThanking you.\nCitizen.",1,3,2,934,2,27,25,"27-01-2017 09:52","Reg:- Extortion/ corruption/bribe","Borivali, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400091, India"

W0120C216393,"Hi There, 

Starting from Magnet mall till Doctor Hedgewar Chowk(Sohnapur Signal),traffic remains very high , because of 2 reasons :

1. old,uneven, narrow brick roads. 
2. Encroachment from both side (which covers almost half of road with trucks ,tempo ,vendors,shops).

Stragely this issue remains only till you cross bhandup west via LBS road .  but if you cross to mulund or kanjurmarg , same LBS road doesn't looks that bad.

Some road widening work in going around Dreams mall(near Bhandup Station) which is good but won't help if encroachment is not removed .

Request you to please look into this matter urgently as daily accidents also takes place due to these issues.

Feel free to reach me for any additional information ,
(will try to upload the pics ASAP)

Thankyou
Rohit

I am writing this to you because I have seen that in my locality..every six months the BMC people come and clean the sewers and keep the debri outside the sewers. This leads to breeding of mosquitoes and we are all in danger of other diseases. With rains round the corner, the debris will go back to the drains with the rains or with car tyres and will again block the drains.   Why can't they get a small vehicle to carry the debris along with them? Our entire lanes are looking so filthy. We want to see our area neat and clean.  We want to see our India Swachch.. I sincerely hope that someone will look into the matter at the earliest.

Since Past few there is total darkness in thakur complex post 10.30pm.

I walk my dog at night and feel unsafe even to get out of building compound because of such people roaming freely in abscence of Street lights. Street lights brings them in attention and they avoid drinking in open but due to blackout in the area they roam freely.

W09500C290218,"With the recent onset of record breaking heavy rains in the city, the deplorable state of the roads in the aftermath is one that is hard to turn a blind side to. Since 2011, the BMC was keeping account on the number of potholes in the city but declared it a futile exercise this year said the Municipal Commissioner Ajoy Mehta. 

In a recent life threatening accident, Prashant Pashankar, a lawyer in the making was supposed to receive his law degree from the Bar Council of India in a few days is currently in KEM hospital in a semi unconscious state. He was on his way to a meeting at the Fort and was ambushed by a deep pothole. To avoid this pothole, he veered in the opposite direction, but the uneven surface on the other side caused his bike to slip and him to fall unconscious almost immediately. 

The uneven surface of the road was caused by the negligence in filling previous potholes causing unevenness. Mumbai, the city that never sleeps saw a great disruption in activities primarily because of the rain and deplorable conditions on the road. 

The damage caused by these potholes to vehicles is to be noticed as well. The liability though should be BMC’s, citizens’ claims are ignored and repairs to the roads aren’t made. If repairs are made, it is done so in such a manner that the road would need repairing the next season itself. Layering occurs with every new repair made thus causing a break in the road. Often, this layering causes more casualties than potholes itself. 

It is seen as a trend across India where Municipal Corporations and Governments ignore the cries of the common man in issues pertaining to the Public Works Department. A recent change is seen in Bangalore where the Government is taking responsibility of its actions. There is a possibility of this being replicated in Mumbai. The citizens of Mumbai should give BMC a wake up call by standing united against such an important issue, causing damage to life and property. It's time to demand pothole free roads. 

Right now, we have potholes in our roads, vote for change before it becomes roads in our potholes! Reclaim your streets, show your support.",3,6,2,950,15,66,22,"25-10-2017 16:28","Ah!

“From the building I was standing on, I saw her from a distance. An anxiety gripped me as I saw her frantically waving her hand from the adjacent building. There was smoke coming out from the same building. My legs grew weak, and hands shook trembled. I needed to help her, save her. I stood in front of this monstrous distance that separated us. I screamed at her to get out of the fire exit, but she looked clueless. All of this left me weak and nervous.

About to catch the fire, she jumped off from the building. An ambulance arrived but it was too late. The siren of the ambulance kept on wailing. About to reach the death spot, I woke up with a puzzled face. And there was my toy doll beckoning me with her hand to switch the alarm off”.

It was not just a dream for 14 people who died in rooftop pub fire that engulfed a four-storey building in Mumbai’s thriving Kamala Mills complex. All 14 victims killed in the fire died due to suffocation from not being able to find an exit. In the last 60 days, 295 fire incidents have taken place as per the recent data by the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation).

According to the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) officials, however, the pub did not have emergency exits, which led to over 200 people getting trapped inside. The pubs did not have working fire safety equipment and flammable material such as tarpaulin sheets",1,66,2,942,5,312,27,"22-03-2018 12:46","Save Mumbai before it becomes an ASH","Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"
